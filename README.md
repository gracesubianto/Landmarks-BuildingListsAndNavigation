# Landmarks-BuildingListsAndNavigation

This project was created by following a tutorial given by developer.apple.com. 
Completed to continue upskilling in the Swift language and the Xcode IDE, following previous project Landmarks-CreatingAndCombiningViews

Tutorial: SwiftUI Essentials Building Lists and Navigation

From the tutorial brief: "With the basic landmark detail view set up, you need to provide a way for users to see the full list of 
landmarks, and to view the details about each location. You’ll create views that can show information about any landmark, 
and dynamically generate a scrolling list that a user can tap to see a detail view for a landmark. 
To fine-tune the UI, you’ll use Xcode’s canvas to render multiple previews at different device sizes."
